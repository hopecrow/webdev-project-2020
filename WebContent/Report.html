	<h3>Login Details:</h3>
	<h5>
	A Personal login can be created using the registration page, but two accounts have already been created for the purpose of testing. 
	As for the full funcationally of the tester it is recommended to use two profiles for purposes such as having someone to send date information and having someone to recieve the date information.
	<br><br>
	Account 1: <br> Username: Tester <br> Password: test
	<br><br>
	Account 2: <br> Username: Test <br> Password: test
	<br><br>
	More information about these users can be found in the data table or by looking at the population statement in the SQL section above.
	Both of these users already have sent and received date information for the purpose of testing.

	<h3>Description of the Application:</h3>
	<h4>Overall:</h4>
	<h5>
	This web application is a online dating application. Users can register a new account or login with an existing account.
	Once logged in a user can navigate the application using the navigation bar located through out the application. 
	From here a user can view their dating "Profile" or even "Search" other users to date based on their gender, age, and county. 
	They can then take the username of a user they like and plan a date ("Plan Date") with the user proposing a location, day, and time. 
	The user can keep track of the dates they have sent and the status of their invitations by checking out "Sent Dates".
	On the other hand a user can use "Received Dates" to view invitations they have recieved and accept or reject these invitations. 
	This page can also be used to view dates already accepted or rejects for future notice. 
	The user can also logout anytime while using this application once they are logged in. 
	</h5>
	<h4>Page Descriptions:</h4>
	<h5>
	- index.jsp: The index page is used as the login page as this is the first page users will access on this site,
	upon entering a users login detail a session is created and the user is redirected to the homepage of the application. 
	Unless the user is already logged into an active session then the user will be automatically redirected to the homepage.
	<br>- Register.jsp: Very similar to the login page of the application, but instead of retreving information from the database,
	the application is adding a new users information into the database. Once registed successfully the user will be asked to go login. 
	<br>- Home.jsp: This is the first page users will access once logged in, it introduces the website and allows the user to navigate the website using a navigation bar. 
	<br>- logout.jsp: this can be called from all places in the application once the user is logged in by selecting logout in the navigation bar.
	This short jsp code invalidates the session and redirects the user back to the login screen.
	<br>- Profile.jsp: Displays the users profile information using session attributes, this being the same information other users will see when searching. 
	<br>- Search.jsp: This form allows a user to search other users that are using the applcation by gender, age, and location. 
	<br>- SearchResults.jsp: Displays all users that fit the critia of the users search query.
	<br>- MakeDate.jsp: Inculdes a form that allows users to send a date invitation to another user, storing the information in the database. 
	<br>- SentDate.jsp: Allows a user to see all of the date invitations they have sent out and the status of these invitations.
	This page also uses two prepared statements and database relations beteen the username in CCMembers table and the askee in CCDates table.
	<br>- ReceivedDate.jsp: Allows a user to see what date invitations they have recieved, and then accept or reject their invitations, along with displaying date invitations they have already accepted and rejected. 
	This page also uses four prepared statements and database relations beteen the username in CCMembers table and the asker in CCDates table.
	<br>- Style.css: This is the css style sheet that was externally used to style the html content of the jsp pages.
	</h5>
